# Blood-Bridge
The one stop solution connecting blood donors and organizations. 
Blood shortages are a global challenge, even during normal times, and crises like the current pandemic exacerbate the problem. This platform aims to bridge the gap between blood donors, Blood Banks, Hospitals, and Organizations involved in blood management. It enables Organizations to publicly share their blood requirements, specifying the needed blood group and type, as well as their available stock. Donors can directly contact these organizations to volunteer for donations. Additionally, organizations with a surplus of specific blood types can collaborate to address shortages. NGOs and Blood Banks can also use the platform to publicize Blood Donation Camps, including location details, making it easier for willing donors to contribute.
